**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169681
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you like me, reading about people fading away as they burn out, and feeling unable to relate? Do you feel like your feelings are invisible to the world because you‚Äôre experiencing burnout differently? When burnout starts to push down on us, our core comes through more. Beautiful, peaceful souls get quieter and fade into that distant and distracted burnout we‚Äôve all read about. But some of us, those with fires always burning on the edges of our core, get hotter.

### 2. Asynchronous Design Critique: Giving Feedback
**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169660
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feedback, in whichever form it takes, and whatever it may be called, is one of the most effective soft skills that we have at our disposal to collaboratively get our designs to a better place while growing our own skills and perspectives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we‚Äôre already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it‚Äôs a skill that can be trained, grown, and imp

### 3. Asynchronous Design Critique: Getting Feedback
**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169639
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‚ÄúAny comment?‚Äù is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It‚Äôs vague and open ended, and it doesn‚Äôt provide any indication of what we‚Äôre looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request.&nbsp;</p>

**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="E1205">We‚Äôve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinit

**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169575
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 1950s, many in the elite running community had begun to believe it wasn‚Äôt possible to run a mile in less than four minutes. Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn‚Äôt built for the task.&nbsp;</p>

**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that ‚Äúintention without strategy is chaos.‚Äù We‚Äôve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech‚Äîbut what, <em>specifically</em>, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.</p>

### 8. A Content Model Is Not a Design System
**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169531
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an <em>omnichannel content strategy</em>, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.</p>

**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169510
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You <em>know</em> a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact

### 10. Breaking Out of the Box
**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169488
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.</p>

**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169466
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About two and a half years ago, I introduced the idea of <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/daily-ethical-design/">daily ethical design</a>. It was born out of my frustration with the many obstacles to achieving design that‚Äôs usable and equitable; protects people‚Äôs privacy, agency, and focus; benefits society; and restores nature. I argued that we need to overcome the inconveniences that prevent us from acting ethically and that we need to elevate design ethics to a

### 12. Mobile-First CSS: Is It Time for a Rethink?
**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169445
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"intro"} -->
<p class="intro">The mobile-first design methodology is great‚Äîit focuses on what really matters to the user, it‚Äôs well-practiced, and it‚Äôs been a common design pattern for years. So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too‚Ä¶right?&nbsp;</p>

**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169423
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a UX professional in today‚Äôs data-driven landscape, it‚Äôs increasingly likely that you‚Äôve been asked to design a personalized digital experience, whether it‚Äôs a public website, user portal, or native application.

**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Humility, a designer‚Äôs essential value‚Äîthat has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager‚Äôs essential value? Or a dentist‚Äôs? Or a librarian‚Äôs? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we‚Äôre going to talk about why.</p>

**Source**: A List Apart | **Time**: 2025-05-26 09:09:07.169377
**Summary**: <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a creative. What I do is alchemy. It is a mystery. I do not so much do it, as let it be done through me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a creative. Not all creative people like this label. Not all see themselves this way. Some creative people see science in what they do. That is their truth, and I respect it. Maybe I even envy them, a little. But my process is different‚Äîmy being is different.</p>
